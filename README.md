# DANK - Dense Analysis Network Knowledge

DANK is a Dense Analysis project focused on collecting and analyzing live data
from the public Internet. It uses API access, web scraping, RSS feeds, and
semantic indexing tools to ingest external content in real time. It
applies sentiment analysis, semantic clustering, and AI models to build
structured insights about the world, including trends, public perception, and
evolving narratives. The goal is to automate contextual understanding and
surface relevant knowledge as it emerges.
